## Data Scientist
Holding a bachelorâ€™s degree in applied mathematics and a master's degree in applied informatics, I have strong experience in working with large datasets, analyzing them, and building and applying sophisticated machine learning, deep learning, optimization and heuristics algorithms. As a data scientist a potential mathematics background keeps me on track when it comes to modeling, problem solving, and interpretation of results.
