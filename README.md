## Data Scientist
Holding a B.Sc. degree in applied mathematics and a M.Sc. degree in applied informatics, I have strong experience in working with large datasets, analyzing them, and building and deploying sophisticated machine learning, deep learning, and heuristics algorithms from scratch. As a data scientist a potential mathematics and statistics background keeps me on track when it comes to modeling, problem solving, and interpretation of results.
